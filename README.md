# Project Name: Vikingbot

Vikingbot is a small motor-driven robot utilizing Python, ROS, Dialogflow, Amazon Polly, and OpenCV to perform different applications
  
# Project Goals

Facial Recognition
- Vikingbot rotates to align itself with faces it detects in front [done]

Gesture Recognition
- Vikingbot will nod its head when it sees a smile [done]

Color Tracking
- Vikingbot will rotate and follow an orange ball when it is detected [done]

IR Sensors
- Vikingbot will prevent itself from crashing by using IR sensors to detect distance from obstacles [done]

Speech to Text
- Using Dialogflow to check intents and respond with the correct actions [done]

Text to Speech
- Using Amazon Polly to convert lines of dialogue to MP3's so they can be played through speakers [done]

ROS Integration
- Previous components can now be used in conjunction with ROS rather than being used individually (No OpenCV yet) [done]
